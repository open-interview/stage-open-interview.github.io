  <title>You&#039;re designing capacity planning for a microservices platform handling 100M requests/day with 3x traffic spikes during flash sales. Each service has different resource profiles: API gateway (CPU-bound, 2ms avg), user service (memory-bound, 50ms avg), payment service (I/O-bound, 200ms avg), and inventory service (database-bound, 100ms avg). Design a capacity planning strategy that accounts for cascading failures, auto-scaling lag (2-3 minutes), and maintains 99.9% availability during peak loads.</title>

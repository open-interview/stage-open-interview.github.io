Use threading.Lock for thread safety and generic typing support.","explanation":"## Context\n\nThis question assesses understanding of design patterns, concurrency, and Python-specific implementation trade-offs. Senior developers should compare multiple singleton approaches and justify their choice.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Metaclass Approach\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeVar, Type, Optional\nimport threading\n\nT = TypeVar('T')\n\nclass SingletonMeta(type):\n    _instances: dict[Type, object] = {}\n    _lock: threading.Lock = threading.Lock()\n    \n    def __call__(cls: Type[T], *args, **kwargs) -> T:\n        if cls not in cls._instances:\n            with cls._lock:\n                if cls not in cls._instances:\n                    instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)\n                    cls._instances[cls] = instance\n        return cls._instances[cls]\n\nclass DatabaseConnection(metaclass=SingletonMeta):\n    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):\n        self.connection_string = connection_string\n        self._connection = None\n```\n\n### Decorator Approach\n\n```python\ndef singleton(cls: Type[T]) -> Type[T]:\n    instances: dict[Type[T], T] = {}\n    lock = threading.Lock()\n    \n    @functools.wraps(cls)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> T:\n        if cls not in instances:\n            with lock:\n                if cls not in instances:\n                    instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)\n        return instances[cls]\n    \n    return wrapper\n\n@singleton\nclass Logger:\n    def log(self, message: str) -> None:\n        print(f\"Log: {message}\")\n```\n\n### Module-level Approach\n\n```python\n# config_manager.py\nclass _ConfigManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.settings: dict[str, Any] = {}\n    \n    def get(self, key: str, default=None):\n        return self.settings.get(key, default)\n    \n    def set(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:\n        self.settings[key] = value\n\nconfig_manager = _ConfigManager()  # Module-level singleton\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n- **Metaclass**: Compile-time enforcement, supports inheritance, complex to understand\n- **Decorator**: Runtime flexibility, easy to apply, affects class signature\n- **Module-level**: Simplest, GIL-protected, no lazy loading, less flexible\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n\n- How would you test singleton behavior across multiple processes?\n- What happens with pickle serialization of singletons?\n- How would you implement a singleton that resets for testing?\n- When would you choose dependency injection over singleton?","diagram":"graph TD\n    A[Thread 1 Request] --> B{Instance Exists?}\n    C[Thread 2 Request] --> B\n    B -->|No| D[Acquire Lock]\n    B -->|Yes| K[Return Instance]\n    D --> E{Double Check}\n    E -->|No| F[Create Instance]\n    E -->|Yes| G[Release Lock]\n    F --> H[Initialize]\n    H --> I[Store in Class Dict]\n    I --> G\n    G --> K\n    J[Thread N Request] --> B","difficulty":"advanced","tags":["pep8","typing","testing"],"channel":"python","subChannel":"best-practices","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":"Imagine you have a special toy that only one kid can play with at a time.

You can have different rules about how to share toys: one way is having a playground boss who decides (metaclass), another is putting a special sticker on the toy box (decorator), or just having one toy box for the whole school (module-level).

They're two different cars that just happen to look alike. That's like using 'is' to check if they're the same object. In Python, when you make two lists with the same numbers, they're like those two toy cars - they look identical (== says True) but they're actually two separate objects in the computer's memory (is says False).
